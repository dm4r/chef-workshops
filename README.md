My chef-repo
===============
All installations require a central workspace known as the chef-repo. This is a place where primitive objects--cookbooks, roles, environments, data bags, and chef-repo configuration files--are stored and managed.

Currently playing around with the Awesome Appliance Repair app using Apache and MySQL (and other pre-reqs),  Yes, the cookbook is pretty cludgy at the moment and is a starting point that begs for iterative improvements :)
